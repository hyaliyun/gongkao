## What types of files can I upload to Drive?

You can upload any type of file to Drive and convert certain types of files to a web-based Google document format: Docs, Sheets, or Slides.

## How much storage do I get with Drive?

Free Google Drive users get 15 GB of storage. Storage for Google Workspace customers varies by edition. For details, please visit the Google Workspace [pricing page](https://workspace.google.com/pricing.html) for more information.

## How does Drive in Google Workspace differ from free Drive?

Google Workspace’s Drive provides twice the amount of storage, 24/7 phone and email support, sharing controls, and advanced reporting. You can upgrade to unlimited storage (accounts with fewer than 5 users get 1TB/user) for an additional fee. See Google Workspace’s [pricing details](https://workspace.google.com/pricing.html) for more information.

# Meet

## Can external participants join a call?


Absolutely. For the no-cost version of Google Meet, participants can either sign in with a Google Account or be approved by the meeting organizer to join.

For Google Workspace customers, once you’ve created a meeting, you can invite anyone to join even if they don’t have a Google Account. Just share the link or meeting ID with all meeting participants.

## Is the meeting content secure?

Yes. All video and audio streams in Meet are encrypted. Users can join securely even when they're off site.

## Is a third-party service required for dial-in access?

No. With Google Workspace ’s [Enterprise edition](https://workspace.google.com/pricing.html?tab_activeEl=tabset-companies), you have the ability to include a phone number and PIN on each of your meetings with no other configuration required. Check the [dial-in documentation](https://support.google.com/meet/answer/7291345?hl=en) for further details.
